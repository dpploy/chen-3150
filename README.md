This course is developed to create a virtual learning environment for Chemical Engineering students with a passion for gaining hands-on skills in the Unit Operation (UO) Laboratory regarding heat transfer and fluid mechanics concepts. Digital CHEN-3150 is providing insight into employing experimental design trechniques to collect and analyze data. Experimental modules are desined to be a replica of the real-life apparatuses. This platform enables the students to run their own experiments, modify their procedure, and make experimental observation by engaging their critical thinking.
